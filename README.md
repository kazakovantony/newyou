Android-AOPExample [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/android10/Android-AOPExample.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/android10/Android-AOPExample)
==================

This is a simple example of [Aspect Oriented Programming in Android](http://fernandocejas.com/2014/08/03/aspect-oriented-programming-in-android/) as part of a blog post I have written.
The idea was to measure how long takes a method to be executed, so based on annotations, a Metrics aspect was created for making easy to trace a method execution (you can take a look at the 'gintonic' folder).
I wrote an article about Aspect Oriented Development in Android here:

After developing this I realized Jake Wharton has already created a very useful library called [Hugo](https://github.com/JakeWharton/hugo) (I refactored my code to look like this amazing library but mine is kind of a more primitive version, although as an example works fine :)).

The idea is simple, you just add `@DebugTrace` to any method and in the logcat you will see something like this:

```
Gintonic --> onMeasure --> [10ms]
```


Local Development
-----------------

Here are some useful Gradle/adb commands for executing this example:

 * `./gradlew clean build` - Build the entire example.
 * `./gradlew installDebug` - Install the debug apk in the current connected device.
 * `adb shell am start -n android10.org.viewgroupperformance/org.android10.viewgroupperformance.activity.MainActivity` - Start the Main Activity of the example.
